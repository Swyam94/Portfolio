# Portfolio
This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website, showcasing my skills, projects, and professional journey as a Data Analyst. The website highlights my expertise in SQL, Python, Power BI, and Excel, along with hands-on projects like Sales Analysis, where I optimized dashboards to identify trends and improve inventory strategies, and Healthcare Analytics, where I reduced hospital readmission rates by 15% through data-driven insights. Built with a clean and responsive design using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the site is hosted on GitHub Pages. You can explore the live website here. If you have any feedback or suggestions, feel free to reach out via email.
